# List of subcountry regions

# subcountries are defined as aggregations of NUTS (nuts1, nuts2 or nuts3) regions

# refer to `nuts1.yaml`, `nuts2.yaml`, `nuts3.yaml` for the definition of nuts regions

# e-highway2050 clusters
# e-highway2050 is a EU-funded project (2012-2015) whose objective was to provide a 
# modular and robust expansion plan for the Pan-European Transmission Network from 2020 to 2050
# In particular it defined a cluster model of the Pan-European transmission grid  (D2.2)
# See https://docs.entsoe.eu/baltic-conf/bites/www.e-highway2050.eu/e-highway2050/

# e-highway clusters were used in the plan4res project (www.plan4res.eu) to create its public dataset
# we will describe here only the clusters that are used in plan4res public dataset, which are those
# describing France, Germany and Italy. For the rest of europe, country or regional aggregation is used in plan4res
# they are defined as an aggregation of a list of NUTS3 regions
