# List of variables related to energy
# sector describe the end-users (who uses the energy) ; 
#        can be industrials, commercial, residential
# energy use describe the uses of energy (what is used that energy for); 
#        can be transportation, heating, cooling, industrial process, losses, other 
# energy source describe the source of energy (which energy is used); 
#        as we are describing final energy, it can be electricity, fossil, liquid, solid, coal, biomass, solar...
#        meaning eg coal directly burnt for heating 
#        uses of 'energy sources' for producing electricity are not accounted here
