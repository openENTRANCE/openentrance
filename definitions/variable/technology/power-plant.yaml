# List of variables related to power plants
# Variables related to the production cost of a power plant
# Note that:
# linear   term cost   [EUR/GWh] = Linear Var Cost [Mcal/MWh] * Price|Primary Energy [EUR/Mcal] + Operation and Maintenance Variable Cost [EUR/MWh] * 1e-3
# constant term cost   [EUR/h]   = Constant Var Cost [Mcal/h] * Price|Primary Energy [EUR/Mcal]
