# List of variables related to final energy consumption

# The following attributes are used in this file
# - 'sector' describes the users
#    e.g., industry, commercial, residential
# - 'energy use' describes the uses of energy
#    e.g., transportation, heating, cooling, industrial process, losses, other
# - 'energy source' describes the fuel or energy carrer
#    e.g., electricity, fossil, liquid, solid, coal, biomass, solar...
#    use of 'energy sources' for producing electricity are not accounted here
# Note that:
# - "GWh" is used for data in a subannual resolution 
# - "EJ/yr" is used for data in a yearly resolution (i.e., a single value for one year (e.g., 2020) and not the time period until the next data point).
