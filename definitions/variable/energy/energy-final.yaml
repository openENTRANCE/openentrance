# List of variables related to final energy consumption

# The following attributes are used in this file
# - 'sector' describes the users
#    e.g., industry, commercial, residential
# - 'energy use' describes the uses of energy
#    e.g., transportation, heating, cooling, industrial process, losses, other
# - 'energy source' describes the fuel or energy carrer
