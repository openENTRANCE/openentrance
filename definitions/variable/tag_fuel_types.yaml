# This list of fuels will replace any occurrence of `<Fuel>`
# in a variable-definition yaml file

# All fuels that have the attribute "ccs: True" have two sub-categories
# "w/ CCS": with a CO2 capture component
# "w/o CCS": with freely vented CO2 emissions (example "Coal|w/o CCS")
#
#   e.g., the energy type "Coal" used for electricity generation
#   is described by three variables:
#   - Secondary Energy|Electricity|Coal
#   - Secondary Energy|Electricity|Coal|Coal|w/ CCS
#   - Secondary Energy|Electricity|Coal|Coal|w/o CCS
