# This list is intended for use as input energy storage system to the power sector

- Electricity Storage Type:

  - Energy Storage System:
      description: all types of energy storage including pumped hydro and batteries
  - Energy Storage System|Hydro:
      description: all hydropower storage systems
  - Energy Storage System|Hydro|Pumped Storage:
      description: hydropower systems with short-term storage capacity
        (including pumping turbines)
      notes: This variable should only include electricity generation from natural
        inflow of water into the upper reservoir. Electricity from storage operation
        should be denoted by *"Injected Energy|.."* and *Discharded Energy|..*.
        This hydropower system has two water reservoirs at different elevations.
        The definition follows the convention established
        by the ENTSO-E transparency platform (https://transparency.entsoe.eu).
  - Energy Storage System|Hydro|Reservoir:
      description: hydropower systems with seasonal storage capacity
        (possibly including pumping turbines)
      notes: This definition follows the convention established
        by the ENTSO-E transparency platform (https://transparency.entsoe.eu).
  - Energy Storage System|Pumped Hydro Storage:
      description: pumped-hydro storage
  - Energy Storage System|Lithium-Ion:
      description: lithium-ion batteries
  - Energy Storage System|Redox Flow:
      description: redox flow batteries
  - Energy Storage System|Compressed Air:
      description: compressed air storage systems
