# e-highway2050 clusters

# e-highway2050 was an EU-funded project (2012-2015) whose objective was to provide a
# modular and robust expansion plan for the Pan-European Transmission Network from 2020 to 2050
# In particular it defined a cluster model of the Pan-European transmission grid  (D2.2)
# See https://docs.entsoe.eu/baltic-conf/bites/www.e-highway2050.eu/e-highway2050/

# e-highway clusters were used in the plan4res project (www.plan4res.eu) to create its
# public dataset

# Clusters are defined as aggregations of NUTS[1-3] regions
# refer to `nuts1.yaml`, `nuts2.yaml` & `nuts3.yaml` for the definition of NUTS regions
